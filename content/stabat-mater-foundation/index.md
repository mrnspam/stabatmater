Hans van der Velden started collecting Stabat Mater compositions in 1992. After his passing in 2005, Hannie van Osnabrugge continued the search and manages the site.

In 2020 the Ultimate Stabat Mater Website Foundation was created to preserve and expand this unique collection for musicians and music lovers around the world.
