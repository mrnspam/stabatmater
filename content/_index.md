## Why this Stabat Mater website?

Initiator of this website, [Hans van der Velden](https://stabatmater.info/stabat-mater-foundation/), began this journey of musical discovery in 1992 with the Stabat Mater from [Haydn](https://stabatmater.info/stabat-mater-foundation/). He searched systematically and persistently for composers, performances on CD and translations of the original Latin poem. He brought the religious, literary, and musical world of the Stabat Mater to life. [We are proud](https://stabatmater.info/stabat-mater-foundation/) to continue his work.
